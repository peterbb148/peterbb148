# About me

30+ years of experience within professional software development of IT systems ranging from research, military, pharmaceutical, mobile & line of business in both national and international organizations.

First decade as a developer on pretty much every platform using a wide range of programming languages. Eventually settling on three tier web based systems.

Second decade I gradually moved into the architect role and progressed to Enterprise Architecture & IT-based strategic approaches to business development.

Third and current decade Iâ€™m focusing on cloud computing as an enabler of business though innovative use of technology resulting in faster, cheaper and better IT projects. I use bleeding edge technology to disrupt the old ways of doing stuff with new smarter ways!

Have spent the last almost two years doing solutions in AWS and before that almost 10 years in Azure.
