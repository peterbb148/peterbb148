# About me

30+ years of experience within professional software development of IT systems ranging from research, military, pharmaceutical, mobile & line of business in both national and international organizations.

First decade as a developer on pretty much every platform using a wide range of programming languages. Eventually settling on three tier web based systems.

Second decade I gradually moved into the architect role and progressed to Enterprise Architecture & IT-based strategic approaches to business development.

Third and current decade Iâ€™m focusing on cloud computing as an enabler of business though innovative use of technology resulting in faster, cheaper and better IT projects. I use bleeding edge technology to disrupt the old ways of doing stuff with new smarter ways!

Currently I'm managing the hybrid/remote software engineering team at Carlsberg with about 75 engineers (developers, architects, devops, dataops, qa & support) in Portugal, Malaysia and Philippines.

I set the direction for architecture, software development and processes to ensure continuous improvement across usage of technology in all aspects within the growth products area.

I also spend a lot of time thinking about AI and we can use it to solve problems faster.
